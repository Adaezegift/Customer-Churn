This GitHub repository contains a detailed analysis of customer churn in ConnectTel, emphasizing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering. 

# OBJECTIVES
The ultimate goal is to empower ConnectTel to reduce customer attrition rates, enhance customer loyalty, and maintain a competitive advantage in the fast-paced and competitive telecommunications industry. By addressing the customer churn challenge through data-driven insights, our solution will contribute to ConnectTel's efforts to provide exceptional customer service, improve business outcomes, and continue revolutionizing the telecom industry.

# OVERVIEW
By gaining insights into customer churn, with aim to inform decision-making for customer retention strategies and business growth. In this project, I performed a comprehensive EDA to understand the dataset and its features. Some of the EDA done involves;
a.  Visualized the relationships between key features and the target variable (customer churn).
b.  Explored correlations among features to identify significant patterns.
c.  Conducted univariate and bivariate analyses to gain a deeper understanding of the data.

Feature engineering is essential for preparing data for machine learning models. In this project, I Encoded categorical variables to prepare them for modeling, Introduced new features where necessary to enhance model performance.

# DATA SOURCES
The dataset used in this project was provided by 10Alytics.

I welcome contributions and feedback to enhance the analysis and extend the project's capabilities.

Note: This is an open-source project with the goal of improving customer retention strategies for ConnectTel.
